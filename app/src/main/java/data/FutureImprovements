- The ingredients in a recipe all have a amountHave, which serves no purpose to a recipe
    may change the structure or let the recipe object make sure it is always 0

- Recipe is not a list of ingredients itself, but has a variable for that
    may need to change the structure to solve this, but couldn't think of a good solution
